Drawings for Shelley Haskell Test Network

An aid to Cardano Shelley Friends and Family exercises:
  HTN Node Keys for the early exercises, 
  HTN Stakepool registration for exercises 4 to 6 
 
 The drawings are not a rigorous tutorial on the exercises but an aid in what you are trying to achieve and a place-holder for what you have already generated. 
 
 
 Drawn in Microsoft Visio 2015 and presented in A3 pdfs
